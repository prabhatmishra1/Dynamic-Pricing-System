Project Overview
This project provides a pricing system with the following main components:

Products: Different types of products (e.g., seasonal products, bulk products) with customizable pricing rules.
Discounts: Discount mechanisms (percentage-based or fixed amount) applied to orders.
Orders: Calculates total prices based on included products and discounts.
The main logic is implemented with OOP principles in a separate dynamic_project.py file and further enhanced with Django models and REST APIs for real-world use.

Features
Dynamic Pricing: Calculate product prices dynamically based on conditions like seasonal discounts or bulk purchases.
Discounts: Apply discounts to orders, either as a percentage or a fixed amount.
REST API: Exposes endpoints for creating products, discounts, and orders with Django REST Framework.
Unit Tests: Test cases to validate product pricing, discount application, and order total calculations.
